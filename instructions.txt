instructions for site usage:
you can easily create user accounts by signing up.
during signup, an otp will be sent to the user email - since we have not set up any real email sending logic, the email will be dumped as an output in the terminal window where the mail server is running
so you can verify the otp from there.
you can then book a ticket - once you have booked a ticket, you can even view this in the admin dashboard
to access the admin dashboard, scroll down to the bottom of the homepage of the site. here you will find an admin login button
you can login to the admin dashboard to see current tickets and user feedback. you can cancel tickets from the table view or even enter scanning mode to scan a ticket.
the credentials for admin login are
email: adminuser@ticketease.com
password: admin@ticketease
for scanning tickets, hold up the QR code of the ticket in front of your camera and click the scan button.
the ticket will be scanned, validated and then cancelled.

instructions to edit:
if you wish to edit this app, you can make most of the needed changes without installing anything additional
however, if you wish to edit/add new tailwind classes, you will need to 
1. install npm (nodejs)
2. run 
npm install tailwindcss
3. run the following command
npx tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/dist/css/output.css --watch

this will compile the tailwindcss classes to the output.css file as you add them
